# Work Day Scheduler

This is a simple calendar that you can use to keep track of appointments, events, and other things to do throughout your workday.
The calendar keeps track of the current time using third-party APIs.
Time slots are color-coded for convenience:
- Past - grey
- Present - red (urgent!)
- Future - green
